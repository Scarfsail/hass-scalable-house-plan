## Currently:
Home assistant does support pinch to zoom on the whole website. When I want to zoom on the overview, the whole gets zoomed including the navigation and the header. This is not ideal, because I want to zoom on the overview and not on the whole website.

## Feature request:
When I pinch to zoom on the overview, only the overview gets zoomed and not the navigation and the header. This way I can zoom on the overview and not on the whole website. 
Also, when I then open a detail room, the zoom level of the overview is not applied to the detail room. This way I can zoom on the overview and not on the detail room.
Besides the pinch to zoom, I should be able to drag the overview around when I have zoomed in. This way I can zoom on the overview and then drag it around to see different parts of the overview.
